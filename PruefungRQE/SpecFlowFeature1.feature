	As a math idiot
	I want to be told the sum of two numbers

Scenario: Sinus
    Given the first number is PI
    When sinus is taken from this number
    Then the result should be 0

Scenario: Cosinus
    Given the first number is PI
    When cosinus is taken from this number
    Then the result should be -1

Scenario: tangens
    Given the first number is PI
    When tangens is taken from this number
    Then the result should be 0
